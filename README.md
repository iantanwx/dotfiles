## Installation

_For mac, see full install details in [mac/README.md](mac/README.md)._

Clone and run the symlink script:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.io/vg0hV ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap/symlink.sh
```

### Post-Installation

#### Recommended steps

- Create XDG child directories (run `bootstrap/xdg.sh`). The base directories
  are probably already initialized by
  `/etc/xdg/autostart/user-dirs-update-gtk.desktop`.
- Install and use [Fira (Fura) Mono for Powerline] font (install
  to `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/fonts` on \*nix)
- Install zsh and change default shell to it (ensure listed in `/etc/shells`)
  and restart shell (zplug will self-install)
- See OS specific notes in [mac/README.md](mac/README.md) and for linux
  [linux/README.md](linux/README.md) and [linux/arch.md](linux/arch.md)
- Chrome extensions I use are listed in
  [chromium/README.md](chromium/README.md)

#### Dev environment setup

Install these using the system package manager. For macOS/OS X there are helper
scripts.

- `chruby`, `ruby-install`, then use ruby-install to install a version of ruby
- Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) MANUALLY via git clone into
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, then use it to install a version of `node` (and
  `npm install --global npm@latest`)
- `php`, `composer`, use composer to install `wp-cli`
- Use [pyenv-installer] for `pyenv`, `pyenv-virtualenv`, then create a new env
  with a new python/pip.
    - Remove `~/.local/pyenv` if it exists prior to installing `pyenv` via
      [pyenv-installer] (e.g. had installed it via `brew` by accident)
    - Create virtualenvs for neovim.

### Provisioning scripts

These will assist in installing packages and dotfiles. Best to have the
Environment set up first.

- `bootstrap/cleanup.sh` moves some dotfiles into their XDG Base Directory
  supported directories
- `bootstrap/symlink.sh` symlinks rc files for bash, zsh, ack, (neo)vim, etc.
- `bootstrap/terminfo.sh` will copy/compile terminfo files for user to
  `~/.terminfo/*`
- `bootstrap/x11.sh` symlinks `.xbindkeysrc`, `.xprofile`
- `npm/install.sh` install default packages, requires you set up nvm and
  install node first
- `ruby/install-default-gems.sh` requires you set up chruby and install a ruby
  first
- `python/install.sh` requires you set up pyenv. Install default pip packages

## Updating

The sourced `dko::dotfiles::main()` function is available as the alias `u`.
Use `u` without arguments for usage.

## Notes

- `bin/`
    - There's a [readme](bin/README.md) in `bin/` describing each
      script/binary. This directory is added to the `$PATH`.
- `local/`
    - Unversioned folder, put `zshrc`, `bashrc`, `npmrc`, and `gitconfig` here
      and they will be automatically sourced, LAST, by the default scripts. _No
      dots on the filenames._
- `git/`
    - The comment character was changed from `#` to `;` so I can use Markdown
      in my commit messages without trimming the headers as comments. This is
      also reflected in a custom Vim highlighting syntax in
      `vim/after/syntax/gitcommit.vim`.
- `python/`
    - Never `sudo pip`. Set up a pyenv, and use a pyenv-virtualenv (which will
      delegate to `pyvenv`) if doing project specific stuff, and pip install
      into that userspace pyenv or virtualenv.
- `vim/`
    - If `curl` is installed, [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
      will be downloaded and plugins will install on run. See
      [vim/README.md](vim/README.md) for more information.

### rc script source order

`echo $DKO_SOURCE` to see what files were loaded to get to the current shell
state. If you have node installed, the `dko-sourced`
([bin/dko-sourced](bin/dko-sourced)) command has better output formatting.

For X apps (no terminal) the value is probably:

    /etc/profile
    .xprofile
      shell/vars
        shell/xdg

## Shell script code style

- **Script architecture**
    - Use the `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang and write with bash compatibility
    - Create a private main function with the same name as the shell script.
      E.g. for a script called `fun`, there should be a `__fun()` that gets
      called with the original arguments `__fun $@`
    - Two space indents
- **Function names**
    - My helpers for scripting and provisioning via these dotfiles are
      namespaced following [google shell style] as `dko::function_name()`.
      These functions are expected to persist for the lifetime of the script
      or in the shell if the script was sourced.
    - For private functions in a script, use two underscores `__private_func()`
      These function names are safe to reuse after script execution. When
      namespaced, they are in the form of `__dko::function_name()`.
- **Variable interpolation**
    - Always use curly braces around the variable name when interpolating in
      double quotes.
- **Variable names**
    - Stick to nouns, lower camel case
- **Variable scope**
    - Use `local` and `readonly` variables as much as possible over
      global/shell-scoped variables.
